# Machine-Learning
Machine learning projects built with python, sk-learn, pandas and data visualization libraries.



### Linear-Regression-Project ###
Analyzing data from a NYC based e-commerce company. They sell clothing online 
but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers 
come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, 
then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website 
for the clothes they want.

### Logistic-Regression-Project ###
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, 
indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on 
an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict 
whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
